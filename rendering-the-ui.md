# Rendering the UI

As you may have noticed, we have been dealing with the console and displaying nothing in the browser apart from the static text we began with. React comes with the `map()` method that enables us loop through data and display it in the `UI`. You will find this method a common feature with you will use very often as you develop your react projects.

### The `map()` Function

The `map()` function is really handy when dealing with arrays. It enables one to quickly loop through a list displaying the needed data.
